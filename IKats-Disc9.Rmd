## Chapter 9 Section 3 Exercise 9

How large must $n$ be before $S_n = X_1+X_2+...+X_n$ is approximately normal?
This number is often surprisingly small. Let us explore this question with a
computer simulation. Choose $n$ numbers from $[0, 1]$ with probability density
$f(x)$, where $n = 3$, $6$, $12$, $20$, and $f(x)$ is each of the densities in Exercise 7.
Compute their sum $S_n$, repeat this experiment 1000 times, and make up a
bar graph of 20 bars of the results. How large must $n$ be before you get a
good fit?

Probability density functions from Exercise 7:

a. $f(x) = 1$
b. $f(x) = 2x$
c. $f(x) = 3x^2$
d. $f(x) = 4|x-1/2|$
e. $f(x) = 2-4|x-1/2|$
